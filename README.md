# Machine-Learning-in-Python
This repository contains some basic machine learning algorithms using Python programming. Here is a list of the machine learning alogorithms that are contained in the Repository. 
**PS: There is only one section for the Deep Learning containing Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks(ANN and CNN). I have created a separate repository for only Deep Learning Modules.**

Here is a link to the following:
